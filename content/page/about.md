## Past Work

#### Cross-Platform frameworks: A comparative study

Along with Intelygenz and the University of Cádiz, I developed an study about the performance of the most used Cross-Platform technologies in the software developement industry (React Native, Ionic, Weex and Flutter). 

For that I developed one benchmark application in each one of he frameworks and meassured in them execution times and code quality metrics.

#### GuessIt!

I worked as an intern on a software project at University of Cádiz. That project is called **“GuessIt!”** and is an application for mobile platforms, mainly Android.

The aim of the project is achieve an app which an student would use to learn languages like English or German.
