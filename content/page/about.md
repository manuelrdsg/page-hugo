Hi! I am Manuel, student at Kingston University.

## Work

Currently I'm finishing my degree in Computer Science at Kinston University. Focusing on Software Engineering and Web Development.

## Past Work

I worked as an intern on a software project at University of Cádiz. That project is called **“GuessIt!”** and is an application for mobile platforms, mainly Android.

The aim of the project is achieve an app which an student would use to learn languages like English or German.

If you want more information about the application please check our **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/manuelrdsg/GuessItLanguageTrainer)**
