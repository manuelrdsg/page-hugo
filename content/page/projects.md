## NetflaxCalendar

Developed using *Python* with *Dropbox, Twitter and GoogleCalendar API's* and *Celery*.

If you have ever missed the publication of your favorite series on Netflix, the aim of the app is to add an event to a Calendar in GoogleCalendar with the publication date of the series on Netflix. To achieve that it uses Netflix twitter bot's (Such as *[NetflixBot](https://twitter.com/netflix_bot)* or *[ElGallodeNetflix](httpss://twitter.com/gallonetflix)*) tweets ans every time a new tweet is published it adds an event to your series calendar.

Developed by me and *[Luis Gonzaga Rozo Bueno](https://github.com/luisrozo)*

## TodoApp

Developed using *MEAN* (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) technologies and Docker Compose.

The aim of the app is to be a simple task manager application where you could add, modify and remove tasks and set a priority and a due date for them. This app was developed to learn how to use *Docker* and *Electron*.

## TextAdventures

Developed by me and three friends (*[Luis Gonzaga Rozo Bueno](https://github.com/luisrozo), [Juan Antonio Rodicio Lopez](https://github.com/juanrodicio) and [Antonio Velez Estevez](https://github.com/avleze)*).

This was our first game, we wanted to made a text-based game strongly inspired by other similar games such as *Zork*. So we chose Java as our language and we focused on the design, using *Design Patterns*.
