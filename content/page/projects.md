## TextAdventures

Developed by me and three friends (*[Luis Gonzaga Rozo Bueno](https://github.com/luisrozo), [Juan Antonio Rodicio Lopez](https://github.com/juanrodicio) and [Antonio Velez Estevez](https://github.com/avleze)*).

This was our first game, we wanted to made a text-based game strongly inspired by other similar games such as *Zork*. So we chose Java as our language and we focused on the design, using *Design Patterns*.
