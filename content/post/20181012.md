Since I upgraded my Mac to the latest Mojave build, due to it's Dark Mode I was wanting to change the look of my MacOS Terminal.

So, after searching and going through a few tutorials I have completely changed the look of my terminal, here you will find a tutorial about which steps have I made to change my terminal.

## Step 1: Get rid off the default terminal

If we want to choose a different terminal emulator, in MacOS there are two main options:

- **iTerm**
- **Hyper**

During this article we're going to focus on **iTerm** cause it's my terminal emulator's of choice. It offers a wide variety of options and shortcuts. And more important, it has a powerful comunity that feeds the emulator with a wide set of themes. You can check out **iTerm** [here](https://www.iterm2.com/).

On the other hand **Hyper** is prettier, but it is built using Web Techonologies _(HTML, CSS, JS...)_ and due to it has worse performance in comparison with **iTerm**. You can check out **Hyper** [here](http://hyper.is)

But if you are an old fashioned dev, you can also use the MacOS default terminal. Most of the improvements that we are going to cover also work in it.

## Step 2: Welcome to zsh

The next step we're going to take is change our shell from bash to zsh. ZShell offers a wide variety of improvements such as completion, comand history, etc... And most important it will allow us to install oh-my-zsh.

Although zsh is installed in MacOS by default it's an older version, so I would recomend you to download the latest available version through **Homebrew**. If you don't have **Homebrew** (the missing MacOS package installer) installed please check it out [here](https://brew.sh/index_es) and follow the installation instructions.

- For **installing zsh** just run the following command:

    ```
    $ brew install zsh
    ```


- **Verify the installation** with:

    ```
    $ zsh --version
    ```

    That should return the _**current version of zsh**_ 

    {{< image classes="fancybox center" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/verifyInstall.png" thumbnail="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/verifyInstall.png" thumbnail-width="500px" thumbnail-height="50px" title="Verify ZSH install">}}

- **Change your default terminal** to zsh:

    ```
    $ chsh -s $(which zsh)
    ```

- **Verify the change** of shell with:

    ```
    $ echo $SHELL
    ```


    That should print _**/bin/zsh**_

    {{< image classes="fancybox center" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143668/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/verifyShell.png" thumbnail="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143668/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/verifyShell.png" thumbnail-width="480px" thumbnail-height="50px" title="Verify the change of shell">}}

Now, that you have moved to the new zsh world you can try a wide variety of plugins, frameworks and themes for your terminal.

##### NOTE:

After changing your shell to zsh your \$PATH variable has been also modified (now it is using the one from zsh). In order to modify it, open the file ~/.zshrc and paste the following line with the content of your old \$PATH variable (probably located in ~/.bash_profile)


```
export PATH={THE CONTENT OF YOUR BASH $PATH}:$PATH
```


## Step 3: "Oh My ZSH!"

At this point you should have installed, iTerm (or Hyper), Homebrew and zsh. Let's install a zsh framework called oh-my-zsh, which will help us to change between themes and manage plugins. You can check it out [here](https://ohmyz.sh/).

**oh-my-zsh** can be installed via _curl_ using this command:


```
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```


But I strongly recommend you to check the latest intstallation method in their page.

## Step 4: Dress up your terminal emulator

Now that we have already installed oh-my-zsh let's configure it and install a theme based in python's powershell called agnoster.

In order to accomplish that we will have to modify the _~/.zshrc_ file.

1. First of all we will have to **install the powerline fonts** for our terminal. For that, create a directory and clone the content of the following GitHub repository in it and run the installation script.


    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
    $ cd fonts
    $ ./install.sh
    ```


2. Next we will **change the theme** of our shell by opening the ~/.zshrc file and modifying the line ZSH_THEME to angnoster


    ```
    $ open ~/.zshrc
    ```


    Now modify the value of _ZSH\_THEME_ to _"agnoster"_ as indicated in the image

    {{< image classes="fancybox center" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/theme.png" thumbnail="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/theme.png" thumbnail-width="600px" thumbnail-height="400px" title="Theme change">}}

3. **Change the default font** of our emulator

    For that, go to the iTerm preferences (⌘,) and in the profiles tab, text, change the font to **Meslo LG DZ Regular for Powerline** with 14pt of size (You can make your own choiche for the size of the font of your terminal, I use 14pt)

    {{< image classes="fancybox center" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/ASCIIfont.png" thumbnail="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/ASCIIfont.png" thumbnail-width="600px" thumbnail-height="400px" title="Set the default font">}}

4. **Apply the changes** our shell


    ```
    $ souce ~/.zshrc
    ```


## Step 5: "Plug In Baby"

Now we will install a few zsh plugins, oh-my-zsh offers a wide variety of them and I strongly recommend you to play and try a few of them. However, in this tutorial we will add the following plugins:

1. Install **Syntax Highlighting Plugin**. This plugin adds beatiful highlighting as you type the commands.

    For that you have to clone the following Git repository and copy it to the oh-my-zsh plugins directory.


    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
    ```


2. Install **zsh Autosugestion Plugin**. Wich autosuggest a command as you are typing.

    For that you have to clone the following Git repository and copy it to the oh-my-zsh plugins directory.


    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
    ```


3. **Update your ~/.zshrc configuration file** and add the plugins.

    For that, add your plugins under the plugin section as it is shown bellow:

    ```
    plugins=(
        git
        zsh-syntax-highlighting
        zsh-autosuggestions
    )
    ```

    {{< image classes="fancybox center" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/plugins.png" thumbnail="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/plugins.png" thumbnail-width="600px" thumbnail-height="400px" title="Set plugins in ./zshrc file">}}

4. **Apply the change**s to your shell. For that, just run the following command as we have done before.


    ```
    $ souce ~/.zshrc
    ```


## Step 6: Colorls

We are going to modify our ls command for using colorls. Colorls is a ruby gem that adds some beautiful icons and colors to the standard ls command.

1. First of all we need to **install ruby** in order to use the gem installer. It can be installed using the Homebrew package installer:

    ```
    $ brew install ruby
    ```


2. Next, we will **install colorls** using the gem installer.


    ```
    $ gem install colorls
    ```


3. In order to use colorls and display the file icons we will have to **install the Nerd fonts** for non ASCII characters. You can check out the fonts [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

    You can follow any of the installation possibilities displayed in their repository readme, but I recommend you to use the Option 4 and install them via homebrew running the following commands.

    ```
    $ brew tap caskroom/fonts
    $ brew cask install font-hack-nerd-font
    ```

4. Once the fonts are installed you will have to **modify the font for non ASCII characters** in your terminal emulator. In this case **iTerm2**.


    For that, go to the iTerm preferences (⌘,) and in the profiles tab, text, change the box _"Use a different font for non ASCII characters"_ and modify the font to **Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete** with 14pt of size (You can make your own choiche for the size of the font of your terminal, I use 14pt)

    {{< image classes="fancybox center" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/nonASCIIfont.png" thumbnail="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/nonASCIIfont.png" thumbnail-width="600px" thumbnail-height="400px" title="Modify default non-ASCII font">}}

5. Add **an alias for colorls**. If you want colorls to be prompted wvery time you use the ls command you will have to add an alias to the end your ~/.zshrc configuration file. I recommend you to add the following alias:

    ```
    alias ls='colorls --sort-dirs -1'
    alias lc='colorls -lA --sd'
    ```

    {{< image classes="fancybox center" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/alias.png" thumbnail="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540143669/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/alias.png" thumbnail-width="600px" thumbnail-height="400px" title="Set the alias for colorls">}}

    The ls command will now display a vertical list of the directories and files within your directory. The lc command will display more information as the permissions, date of creation or owner.

    {{< image classes="fancybox center" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540144585/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/colorls.png" thumbnail="https://res.cloudinary.com/manuelrdsg/image/upload/v1540144585/Improving%20MacOS%20Terminal/colorls.png" thumbnail-width="600px" thumbnail-height="400px" title="ls & lc">}}

## Conclusions

At this point you should have a fully functional beautiful zsh terminal. In this tutorial it is showed my personal configuration, but there are trillions of different combinations and a wide variety of plugins, frameworks, fonts and themes. I strongly encourage you to try and test a different set of configurations until you feel comfortable with your terminal.

Have a nice day!
